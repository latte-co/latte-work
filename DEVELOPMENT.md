# Development

Requires Rust 1.97, Node 22+, macOS Command Line Tools. `make ci` also
requires actionlint and ShellCheck (install with your package manager). Host server supports macOS
and Linux; v0.1 desktop is validated on macOS. No Windows runtime claim.

`make setup`, `make dev` starts the native application. `make ci` runs the local
gate; `make package` builds an app without Developer ID signing and standalone release host server,
and on macOS also produces the verified drag-install DMG described below.
Use `make build` for a debug native app bundle. On macOS, both build modes
finish with project-owned ad-hoc signing and strict bundle verification. The CLI fixture never calls a model.

## CI and merge checks

`make test-unit` runs Rust crate-local and frontend reducer tests.
`make test-e2e` runs the final server binary through its real socket bridge with
a deterministic Claude CLI fixture. `make test-doc` runs Rust documentation
tests. `make test` runs all three layers; `make ci` also checks formatting,
generated protocol types, Clippy, workflow/shell scripts, the frontend build,
and Rustdoc. `make setup` uses public npm registry URLs recorded in the lockfile.

GitHub Actions runs host check/Clippy, UT, final-binary E2E, and release builds
on Linux and macOS. Frontend UT/build runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows;
Windows also checks, lints, and tests the portable Rust protocol and client.
The server uses Unix sockets and process groups, so Windows CI does not claim
server or native desktop support. A separate macOS job builds the native app.
`PR Gate` fails when any dependent job fails, is cancelled, or is skipped.
The repository ruleset must require `PR Gate` on `main` for this to block a
merge; a workflow file alone does not activate that remote rule.

Like Latte Code, dependencies and lint policy live in the Cargo workspace,
Make is the stable command surface, and Cargo/npm lockfiles are checked in.
Debug information is reduced; release builds use thin LTO. If sccache is on PATH,
Make enables it automatically. Do not globally install tools during setup.
Cargo target defaults to each checkout's target/ (avoids competing worktree
locks). Override CARGO_TARGET_DIR for a dedicated persistent build volume. CI
caches Cargo dependencies and npm content, separately per OS/toolchain/lockfile.
`make clean` never purges sccache, the Cargo registry, npm cache or runtime data.

The server owns projects, sessions, SQLite events and agent children. Exactly
one daemon holds an exclusive file lock per canonical state directory (the
standard user state directory is the default). Clients use a private Unix socket;
SSH runs the same binary's `connect` bridge. The bridge starts the daemon when
absent, then forwards bytes. Disconnecting a bridge does not stop the daemon.
Native `host_request` failures from a broken client carry the private
`HOST_CONNECTION_LOST:` prefix (not a wire-protocol change). The WebView reports
that host as disconnected even for metadata requests, while Server/application
errors remain scoped to their controls. Reconnecting replaces the transport;
late failures from an older connection cannot invalidate its replacement. User
messages are never automatically replayed.
Explicit state-directory overrides exist for tests and separate installations.

The desktop's local transport uses `connect-local`: it compares the running server's
executable SHA-256 with the bundled binary and requests an idle shutdown before
starting the new build. This identity is separate from wire protocol v1. The
private `server_status` / `prepare_upgrade` lifecycle handshake is available before
Hello and is not a WebView API. The latter binds to a server instance and closes
request admission atomically; running/waiting tasks and any open terminal veto it.
Local coordinators serialize via `upgrade.lock` and time out after 20 seconds.
SSH still uses `connect`, with no automatic remote replacement. Legacy daemons
without the lifecycle handshake require a one-time manual restart after tasks
finish and terminals close. Restarting only the desktop leaves them running.

Wire protocol changes: edit latte-work-protocol then run `make types` and
`make fmt`. Desktop presentation must not import or reproduce Claude wire types.

`recent_sessions` reads unarchived history across visible projects on the target host,
100 rows per page with an activity-time/session-ID cursor. Activity comes from saved
conversation events; opening/reading, lifecycle state and pin metadata do not reorder
history. Older databases are supported through an indexed event projection. Local and
SSH use the same request; older servers fail explicitly and should be updated.

Read docs/architecture.md for boundaries and docs/remote.md for SSH installation.

The desktop icon source is `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/source.svg`. Run
`make icons` after editing it, and include the generated PNG and macOS ICNS.
Keep the rounded tile within the 80% canvas safe area for consistent Dock sizing.

Provider protocol smoke tests can use a real installed Claude CLI with disposable
localhost upstream fixtures: `python3 scripts/smoke-providers.py --binary /path/to/latte-work-server --claude /path/to/claude`. This optional native check
uses no paid model API; the automated `make ci` suite uses deterministic fixtures.
See docs/providers.md for module boundaries, persistence and compatibility limits.

## Sidebar terminal development

The terminal uses the v1 protocol contract on both the desktop and host. For isolated
native tests, a debug desktop accepts `LATTE_WORK_SERVER` pointing at a wrapper
that invokes the checkout's server with `--state-dir` in a temporary directory.
Do not replace a user's running daemon to perform smoke tests.

Focused checks: `cargo test -p latte-work-server --test e2e terminal_ --locked`
and `npm test` (frontend includes PTY output-cursor and no-input-replay
regressions). Native checks should cover Tab switching, panel hide/restore,
multiple shells, resizing, shell exit, and keyboard copy/paste.
Confirmed shell exit automatically closes its workspace tab and releases the host
terminal through `close_terminal`. Live output is drained before closing; restored
exited metadata also retires the tab. Disconnects and read failures keep the tab,
and exiting a nested shell does not close a still-running parent shell. Failed
cleanup remains visible for explicit retry rather than automatically replaying it.

## Agent adapter development

`crates/latte-work-server/src/agents/adapter.rs` defines the internal contract;
`agents/mod.rs` registers implementations, and `agents/claude.rs` implements the
only supported Agent. Keep protocol order and wire messages in the implementation.
Runtime consumes common actions and retains approval authorization, process
supervision and persistence. Each opened conversation has a persistent actor and
native process. The additive `open_agent_session` and `close_agent_session`
requests do not send prompts; they share the local/SSH implementation. Runtime
serializes native output, durable turn admission, interruption and close. Native
results finish turns without closing stdin. Task lifecycle and session-state
messages stay in the Claude adapter. Configuration changes are rejected before
admission when background work cannot safely be released. `Ready` must never implicitly send a prompt.

Focused checks: `cargo test -p latte-work-server --bin latte-work-server --locked`
for contract/adapter/runtime UT, followed by `make test-e2e` for real server/bridge
behavior with the deterministic CLI fixture. These do not measure coverage or
validate a live model service. Internal interface changes do not require a wire
protocol version increment.

## Composer references and native Agent commands

`agent_commands` is an additive protocol request scoped to agent and project. The
host launches a metadata-only adapter handshake with a 12-second deadline, bounded
frames/message count and at most two concurrent probes. No user prompt or Latte
session is created. Process groups are terminated after discovery, failure or timeout.
Only the Claude adapter knows the initialize response's command schema. Commands
are checked again against the actual turn's initialize response before sending the
original prompt, avoiding Claude's unknown-command fallback to an ordinary model turn.
The existing send request ID, persistence, resume, cancellation and approval flow are
shared by native commands. Terminal-only commands absent from the native SDK catalog
are not synthesized. Agent command effects and configuration scope remain native;
Latte's explicit model/effort selections continue to apply on each launched turn.

The `@` picker reuses the server's bounded, canonical project-file listing for local
and SSH hosts. It attaches relative path references for the Agent to read, not file
uploads or clipboard screenshots. A remote server must be updated for command discovery.
The `+` menu also accepts explicitly chosen files/folders outside the project:
native pickers are local-only, while manual absolute paths are resolved by the
selected execution host through `resolve_reference`. This bounded metadata-only
request returns a canonical absolute reference (or a project-relative path when
contained). It does not read contents, add allowed directories, change Agent
permissions, or relax `files`/`read_file` canonical containment. Remote hosts need
an updated server for this additive request. Late selection results are discarded
after project, host, session or composer state changes.
Focused tests: `npm test`, adapter/runtime unit tests and the final-binary
`agent_commands_discovery_dispatch_resume_and_unsupported_are_native` test. A real
CLI smoke check should separately verify discovery and a non-model native command.

## Remembered Agent selections

The desktop persists explicit model and effort choices per host / Agent in local
storage. New drafts restore those choices across projects and restarts; existing
sessions retain their own parameters. Reading a catalog or falling back from an
unsupported effort is not an explicit preference change. Selecting native defaults
persists null; missing effort leaves both CLI arguments and native effort environment
untouched, including when a Provider is bound. Claude resolves its own settings.
Focused checks: `useAgentPreferences.test.tsx`, `ModelPicker.test.tsx`, and the
final-binary `effort_is_applied_on_launch_resume_and_reset` test.

## Agent permission modes

The composer requests `agent_permissions` from the execution host. Each adapter
owns discovery, labels and launch mapping. Claude probes the installed CLI's
`--help` (5-second / 128 KiB limits, shared probe concurrency limit); only known,
advertised modes are offered. Account, model and managed-policy eligibility is
still enforced by the native Agent; rejection is surfaced, never replaced by a
different mode. Unsupported adapters fail explicitly.

A nullable `permission_mode` travels with each send, is stored with the Session
and participates in durable request identity. Null omits the CLI override.
Explicit choices are remembered per host / Agent; running turns cannot be changed.
Only the native CLI decides which tools require approval. Requests that reach the
host approval flow retain its single-use session-bound checks, even in bypass mode.
Permission changes do not edit native settings or expand sandbox/network policies.
The Hello capability `permission_settings` prevents a new client from sending
an override to an older server that would silently ignore the field. Remote hosts
must update their server; local and SSH transports share the same implementation.

## Clipboard attachments

Composer paste snapshots text/files before awaiting native work. Plain text stays
at the selection; more than 8,000 UTF-16 code units or 200 lines becomes a UTF-8
`.txt` attachment. File URLs from the macOS pasteboard are handled by native code;
a conflicting text snapshot takes precedence over a subsequently changed clipboard.
Images/video/documents are file references, not simulated vision/video processing.

The desktop stages all pasted bytes in the local host's private `paste-tmp/`
directory under its state directory. An SSH task then receives a streamed copy in
that host's own `paste-tmp/`; only the destination path is attached. The native
adapter does not run Agents or change their permissions. macOS file URLs are
revalidated against the current pasteboard before opening. Local pasted directories
are references only; remote directory transfer is explicitly unsupported.

The additive `begin_attachment` / `attachment_chunk` / `finish_attachment` /
`abort_attachment` protocol bounds chunks to 64 KiB, each file to 64 MiB, concurrent
uploads to 8, and each host's managed cache to 2 GiB / 4,096 entries. Offsets and
declared sizes must match. Files become visible only after complete writes and
fsync; private cache directories use 0700 and files 0600. Incomplete in-memory
uploads expire after ten minutes on subsequent admissions; completed files remain
available for saved prompts and retries. They are not automatically deleted on
session close. Remote servers must be updated before using clipboard transfers.

Tests: `pasteAttachments.test.ts`, `Composer.test.tsx`, server attachment unit tests,
and final-binary `pasted_attachments_are_chunked_host_owned_and_abortable`. Report
native clipboard tests and actual remote-host execution separately.

## App-owned Provider configuration

`latte-work-config` owns App Provider definitions and per-host/Agent choices. It has
no runtime Agent or Server dependency. Tauri accesses it on a blocking worker using
a short-lived OS file lock. UI Provider CRUD must use `provider_request`, never
`host_request` or a local Server connection. Only model discovery and execution
contact the selected host. Each desktop send chooses an explicit snapshot or CLI
configuration, including for the local host. See `docs/providers.md` for read-only
legacy migration, paths and confidentiality requirements.

## Read-only change inspection and presentation metadata

`changes` returns bounded, project-relative `GitChange` entries grouped by staged,
unstaged and untracked status. `change_diff` returns one file's bounded content;
tracked files use literal Git pathspecs with external diff and textconv disabled,
and untracked previews use the existing canonical project containment checks.
The legacy `diff` request remains available, with status scoped to the same project
as its patches. New clients explicitly report unsupported requests on older
servers; use a matching remote Server revision for the structured view.

Approval events may include optional `tool_use_id` metadata from the adapter.
It only links presentation to a known tool call. Authorization remains bound to
the existing public approval request ID, session and single-use runtime decision.
Histories without this metadata still display explicit approval outcomes, but do
not guess which parallel tool an old decision belongs to.

## macOS window and application lifetime

The red close button hides the window and preserves its WebView and drafts. Dock
reopening restores and focuses it. A small macOS Objective-C delegate hook routes Cocoa Dock termination through
the event-backed Quit menu because Tao 0.35 does not expose a cancellable
applicationShouldTerminate callback. It adds only that missing method and leaves
Tao window/reopen handling intact; Rust contains no unsafe code.

Dock Quit and Command-Q silently close resources opened or sent by this App
instance. A dedicated transport bypasses local upgrade checks and UI polling;
cleanup batches are idempotent and bound to both the daemon ID and App owner ID.
The host closes and reaps the Agent process group before acknowledging. An App
reclaim fences stale closes from an earlier App instance. New requests are blocked
while quitting; admitted requests cannot send new work after claiming a resource
if Quit has begun. Prompt input is never replayed.

Quit persists a private, atomic resource record before closing. The UI is never
blocked by a quit-failure dialog: cleanup has an 8-second overall deadline, then
the App exits. Unconfirmed work is not reported as stopped. Tab cleanup is advisory,
with a one-second budget; native resource ownership remains authoritative. Local
unconfirmed closes are resolved before the next local connection is exposed.
A disconnected remote server keeps executing and retains its Agent sessions:
it cannot infer App Quit from SSH EOF. On the next connection, the App reattaches
to surviving remote resources and fetches their actual state; it never replays an
old remote close, Open or Send. If the daemon has restarted or a resource belongs
to a newer App instance, the old record is discarded without touching that resource.
Records contain host targets and resource IDs, never SSH passwords, prompts or
Provider credentials. This lifecycle requires an updated server supporting native
resource ownership. Busy/shared daemons are not force-killed. OS force kill/crash
cannot run explicit cleanup and remains outside this graceful-exit guarantee.

Explicit Quit first emits a native `app-close-requested` transaction. Every mounted
Tab registers `useAppClose`, including hidden tabs: terminal panes await PTY close;
file/change panes pause refresh. Tabs own their cleanup; unmounting or hiding a
window is not a shutdown signal. Tab callbacks have a one-second advisory budget;
stale acknowledgements cannot approve a later Quit. Native ownership tracking
remains authoritative, blocks new work, and retains ambiguous terminal creation
records. Cleanup failures are diagnostic only and retain unconfirmed resource
records without opening a dialog. Within the eight-second overall budget, native
cleanup closes any remaining App-owned terminals and Agent sessions before
dropping connections; unreachable remote resources remain available for adoption
on the next connection.

The local daemon receives the existing instance-bound idle/drain handshake after
cleanup; busy/shared resources veto daemon exit without being killed. Remote daemons
remain alive. No unrelated sessions or terminal IDs are enumerated and killed.
App transport pipes close on exit; connect-local and SSH bridges end on EOF.
Reopening reconciles events without replaying prompts.

## macOS drag-install packaging

- `make package`: build the release server and desktop, ad-hoc sign, then create the DMG.
- `make package-dmg`: package the existing signed release app without rebuilding it.
- Output: `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/bundle/dmg/Latte-Work-<version>-<arch>.dmg`
  and the adjacent `.dmg.sha256`. The default target directory is this checkout's `target/`.
  Version and architecture come from the app bundle and Mach-O binary, not hardcoded release names.

`scripts/package-dmg.sh` provisions a private Python venv in the target directory
using `scripts/dmg-requirements.txt` (pinned versions). macOS, Python 3 with venv/pip,
Command Line Tools and network access on first use are required. It never installs
global Python packages; unchanged dependencies are reused offline.

`scripts/package-dmg.py` owns the 600×400 white installation window, large app and
Applications icons, and center arrow. All staging and alias paths are canonicalized
before creating Finder metadata, avoiding the `/var` versus `/private/var` alias bug.
It validates the background reference, arrow pixels, icon positions, hidden window
chrome, Applications symlink, image checksum and strict bundle signature. It remounts
the compressed image read-only at a different path, checks the layout again, and
compares the desktop/server binary hashes with the source bundle.

The existing output is replaced only after validation succeeds. Temporary mounts
are detached on failure; failed staging directories are retained for diagnosis.
Run packaging serially within a checkout: do not run `make prepare`, debug builds
or another packaging process concurrently, since they share the bundled server.
Native Finder visual acceptance is separate from structural validation: double-click
the resulting DMG and check the arrow and icon layout. Opening its directory in an
existing Finder window can inherit that window's view settings. No Apple notarization
or Developer ID signature is implied.

## Context and usage telemetry

The additive `usage` event is persisted and replayed with normal session events,
shared by local/SSH transports; update the remote server to receive it. Old
histories remain unknown. Presentation filters telemetry before merging streamed
text. The composer exposes one neutral ring with a click/keyboard statistics panel.

Claude assistant input + cache-read + cache-write tokens describe the latest
main-agent request input snapshot, not a live tokenizer or cumulative context.
Per-step output tokens are placeholders and are excluded. Result `modelUsage`
provides contextWindow only for the exact reported model; its cumulative token
counts and subagent totals are never used for context occupancy. Compaction/reset
invalidates the snapshot until a subsequent request. Result usage and API duration
are displayed for the latest submitted turn; sending clears those totals.
Cache hit rate = cache-read / (uncached input + cache-read + cache-write).
Missing capacity/counters remain unknown, including older CLI/provider responses.
Context breakdown, tool duration, TTFT and generation TPS are not fabricated from
wall time. Sources: [SDK cost tracking](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/cost-tracking)
and [SDK wire types](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/blob/main/src/claude_agent_sdk/types.py).

The additive `progress` event carries only waiting/thinking/replying phases.
Claude thinking block/delta events map to thinking without storing their text;
phase changes are deduplicated and subagent phase events ignored. See the
[streaming event contract](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming).
The UI combines phases with current-turn pending tool IDs, explicit approval,
connection and cancel state. Silence never implies thinking; terminal sessions
remove the status line. Both progress and usage are excluded before text merging.

## Agent Shell environment

At daemon startup, the host Server captures exported variables from the user's
default shell (`SHELL`, falling back to the account shell), using `-ilc` in the
home directory. zsh, bash, sh/dash and fish are supported; each shell follows its
own startup-file rules (Bash login profiles must source `.bashrc` if desired).
The snapshot stays in memory and is reused for Agent discovery, permission probes,
command discovery and execution. It does not mutate the daemon environment or
Claude settings. Local and SSH Servers capture independently on their own hosts.

Shell exports overlay inherited variables; host identity, cwd and `LATTE_WORK_*`
controls remain authoritative. Adapter-specific environment removals/overrides and
the explicit per-turn Provider settings apply afterwards. Shell aliases/functions
and project-directory hooks are not imported. New shell configuration is loaded
on Server restart. For service managers or curated environments, set
`LATTE_WORK_AGENT_ENV=inherit` before starting Server to skip shell initialization.

Capture has a 3-second timeout, a 512 KiB output cap and process-group cleanup.
Startup output is discarded using a unique NUL-delimited marker, not logged.
Failure retains the inherited environment and adds a diagnostic to Agent details.
Environment values, including credentials, are never persisted in the snapshot.

Provider authentication defaults follow the selected protocol: Anthropic uses
`x-api-key`; OpenAI uses `Authorization: Bearer`. A new blank API Key saves
`ProviderAuth::None`. Existing hidden credentials are retained until explicitly
cleared; switching to None removes the stored secret. Existing explicit auth
choices remain compatible. Claude Code requires a nonempty credential before
making a request, so the None adapter sends the public, non-secret token
`latte-work-no-auth` rather than inheriting a real credential. Thus None needs no
server-side authentication, but does not promise absence of the Authorization
header for Claude Code. Gateways that reject any such header are not supported
by this adapter.

Provider model catalogs preserve ID-to-display-name mappings in `model_labels`;
older files default to an empty map. Display names never replace IDs in Agent
requests. The native `fetch_provider_models` command resolves a draft's saved
credential only when its endpoint, auth and protocol still match, releases the
configuration lock, then fetches the model catalog. Discovery uses `/v1/models`
for a bare origin and preserves configured API prefixes, with Anthropic cursor
pagination. Requests reject redirects, have a 15-second total deadline, and
bound each response to 1 MiB, five pages and 256 unique models. A failure leaves
the edited catalog unchanged; successful results remain an unsaved draft.

Model discovery first requests the unversioned catalog to retain canonical IDs from
compatible gateways. For Anthropic providers, an HTTP 400 response retries with
`anthropic-version`; the existing timeout and pagination bounds still apply.

Local lifecycle checks retry a failed read-only `server_status` exchange up to three
attempts inside the existing 20-second coordinator deadline. Upgrade admission and
application requests are never retried by this helper. Desktop startup progress
lives in the composer; disconnected errors use a concise retry control with the
original diagnostic available on hover.

Opening historical sessions reads a bounded latest `history` window (up to two
turns, 128 compacted events / 256 KiB, with a 16,384 raw-event scan cap). Consecutive
text fragments are joined for transfer only; original persisted events remain
unchanged. A raw `before` cursor supports older pages without gaps or duplicate
text. Split final text and older unresolved approvals in the current live turn
must be assembled before reveal. Older records load on upward scrolling or explicit
request, preserving the viewport anchor. Older servers without `history_window`
still use the compatible full Poll replay. The conversation reveals the latest
window after positioning at the bottom across two animation frames; later live
updates retain normal follow behavior and manual reading positions. A scope change cancels
pending reveal work so a stale session cannot reveal the new conversation.

## Conversation lifetime and reading position

Opening an unarchived conversation also opens its native Agent session, even without
sending a message. Switching conversations preserves all opened sessions. The
conversation menu's Close releases the native runtime and returns the selected
conversation to a draft; history remains on the host. Stop interrupts one turn
and keeps the native session open. Native reconnect restores every App-owned
session, including conversations not currently selected, without replaying prompts.
An actual process/daemon restart cannot recover in-flight subagents; interrupted
execution stays failed/unknown while native history is reopened. Busy/background
sessions veto an automatic local daemon upgrade. Both desktop and remote Server
need this revision for the additive lifecycle requests.

The transcript stores its scroll offset and follow-latest preference in App memory
per host/session. Switching back restores that position after concealed layout;
newly opened/explicitly closed-and-reopened conversations and recovered host
connections use a fresh reading scope and reveal the latest position. Settings
navigation does not discard reading positions. No scroll preferences persist across
App exit.

Local and SSH hosts share one initialization and connection-reuse flow. Concurrent
startup consumers share the same handshake and project snapshot; switching to an
already connected host does neither again. A deliberate reconnect or a transport
failure replaces the connection and reconciles the owned sessions without sending
prompts. Disconnected hosts retry independently, including hosts whose conversations
are not selected; healthy hosts are never reinitialized by those retries.
Returning to an opened conversation reuses its completed history and polls
after the last sequence number. The in-memory history cache is bounded to 12
conversations and 16 MiB; a changed daemon identity invalidates that host's cache.
Reading-position restoration is independent of transport and cache availability.

Each host keeps independent persistent request lanes for history/UI reads, Agent
control and slower CLI metadata. Local and SSH use identical routing. Additional
lanes attach to the existing daemon during initial connection and are coalesced;
navigation does not create transports. A reconnect replaces all lanes and fences
stale responses by connection identity and daemon ID. No Send is retried.

## Native subagent presentation

The additive `subagent` event and `subagents` request use the same local/SSH protocol.
The server persists a latest child-task projection atomically with each event so a
bounded history window cannot hide a still-running child. Snapshots return up to
128 recent records, with live tasks first and an explicit truncation flag.
Only the Claude adapter interprets native Agent/Task calls, task_started,
task_progress, task_notification and task_updated patches. Tool-use IDs merge
foreground calls with native task IDs; background launch acknowledgements do not
mean completion. Shell background tasks are excluded from the subagent list.
Child tools update child activity rather than the main-agent transcript/status.
A main result does not finish its background children. Explicit process close
marks children stopped only after process-group cleanup; process failure or daemon
restart marks unfinished children unknown, including after a completed main turn.
Transport reconnect neither starts children nor replays their prompts.

The conversation summary opens a closeable Subagents workspace tab, grouped by
active, completed and other states. Selecting a task opens a separate named tab,
keyed by stable child ID; repeated selection reuses it and leaves the list intact.
The child tab shows its result, latest tool and duration without implementation IDs.
Hiding or closing a child tab never stops execution. Child result envelopes cannot
finish the parent turn. Trailing empty/duplicate success results while idle are
ignored; result-only autonomous replies and actual failures remain visible.

The topbar Task Overview popover links to changes and subagents. The Sources
section and source tabs are currently removed from the workspace UI. The source
inventory and scoped preview APIs described below remain available on the host;
Composer references continue to use their existing add and send flow.
For advertised Claude `/agents`, `/list-agents` and `/tasks` commands, the adapter supplies an
optional presentation hint. Selection fills the draft only. Bare `/agents`,
`/list-agents` and `/tasks` submissions are desktop navigation: they open the local
Subagents tab without dispatching a Claude command, creating a conversation or
writing a user event. They clear only the command text and preserve references.
Explicit command arguments still use native dispatch and its presentation hint.
Unsupported commands are not added to the catalog. These controls observe native
execution; individual child steering/stopping is not synthesized.

Focused checks: adapter/store UT, frontend SubagentsPanel/useSubagents/Composer/
useWorkbench tests and the final-binary
`subagents_native_commands_snapshot_reconnect_and_close_share_one_protocol` test.
Native UI and actual model-driven Claude delegation remain separate evidence.
`python3 scripts/smoke-subagents.py` uses the installed real Claude CLI with a
disposable localhost Anthropic model fixture. It verifies actual foreground and
background Agent execution, child Read isolation, terminal notifications,
reconnect snapshots and advertised native listing commands without paid API calls.
It does not verify a live model's delegation decisions. `--pause-for-ui` prints
an isolated state directory and bounded release/finish markers for native UI checks.

### Task changes and source previews

Before the first accepted agent request spawns, the server stores a durable file
baseline in the task database. The request is persisted first. Git-visible files
(including tracked and untracked dirty files) are read without changing the index,
refs or user files. Baselines are limited to 1,000 files, 512 KiB per file, 8 MiB
total and 12 seconds. Unknown, oversized and symlink entries are explicitly partial;
old tasks without a baseline never retroactively infer one. Task totals/diffs compare
this baseline with the current worktree, regardless of staging or later commits.
This is temporal attribution: other writers in a shared directory can appear in
these net changes. The UI provides separate task and workspace views.

Explicit user reference manifests and actual native tool calls are indexed durably.
Tool-use IDs deduplicate calls, including child calls. MCP tool names identify
connector groups; installed-but-unused connectors are never fabricated. Source
inventories return at most 128 entries with a truncation flag.

The host-only preview API reads 64 KiB chunks with a five-second timeout. It accepts
project-contained paths, completed managed uploads, explicitly resolved project
references, or the task's persisted references. Canonical containment is checked;
ordinary read_file boundaries and agent permissions are unchanged. Images, PDF and
video are sniffed from bytes; HTML and SVG remain plain text. Directory previews
skip symlinks. Files larger than 64 MiB fail explicitly. Desktop inline media are
limited to 16 MiB, text to 512 KiB, and full system preview copies to 32 MiB.
Object URLs are revoked on disposal and late responses are fenced by host/task.
The desktop renders PDF first-page thumbnails through macOS Quick Look (two concurrent
renders, ten-second timeout, at most 8 MiB of PNG), with full-document system preview.
No iframe or external document scripts are enabled. Quick Look uses a private 0600 local copy, at most two concurrent processes,
and removes that copy on preview close, application Quit or after one hour. SSH hosts use the same chunked
protocol; the server has no GUI dependency.

Each accepted user turn also saves a request-linked baseline before native dispatch.
At the main result or confirmed process stop/failure, the server freezes before/after
bytes and a `turn_changes` event, atomically replacing the pending baseline. Only
changed bytes are retained (the same per-file/total capture limits apply to both
snapshots). Turn cards show file counts and per-file/total added and removed lines;
selecting a file or View Changes opens a deduplicated, closeable turn tab. Historical
turn diffs read these stored bytes, not HEAD or the current filesystem. Main results
with unfinished background children are explicitly labelled and cannot be undone.
Shared-directory attribution remains temporal; other concurrent writers can appear.
Daemon restart marks unfinished snapshot collection unknown, never captures a late
filesystem state as that turn's result. Legacy turns have no invented snapshots.

Undo is a host operation for the conversation's latest turn only. It requires a
complete snapshot, no active host tasks/background work/PTYs, and byte/permission
matches against every stored after-image. Exclusive host admission prevents new
Send/Open/Approval/terminal writes during restoration; overlapping idle Agent
runtimes are closed and can be reopened normally. Symlink paths are refused and
all files are checked before the first write and again before each atomic replacement.
Files are restored without touching Git's index or refs. A durable unknown intent
precedes writes; only full success becomes reverted. Failure/crash stays unknown
and is never automatically retried. Completed repeated Undo requests reconcile
idempotently. Independent external writers are not locked; post-turn conflicts
are rejected and an interrupted restoration requires manual workspace inspection.
